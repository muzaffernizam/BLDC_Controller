Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (MACRONAME=XLXI_1/XLXI_23, RLOC=X1Y2) which requires the
   combination of the symbols listed below to be packed into a single SLICE
   component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: There are more than two MUXCY
   symbols.
   The symbols involved are:
   	MUXCY symbol "XLXI_1/XLXI_23/XLXI_156" (Output Signal =
   XLXI_1/XLXI_23/XLXI_156/O)
   	MUXCY symbol "XLXI_1/XLXI_23/I_36_110" (Output Signal =
   XLXI_1/XLXI_23/I_36_110/O)
   	MUXCY symbol "XLXI_1/XLXI_23/I_36_63" (Output Signal =
   XLXI_1/XLXI_23/I_36_63/O)
